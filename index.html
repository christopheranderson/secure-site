      <!--

            Merely accessing the source of a webpage 
            is not a crime and we should expect our politicians to
            keep a higher bar before accussing someone, particularly someone in the media who is cooperating with you, just because you're
            embarrassed.

            If you don't know enough to make that distinction, let your more informed deputies
            speak for you.

            An innocent person, trying to help, may be harrassed by random people because of being targetted like this.
            
            Consider your impact before you
            lay charges on someone. The
            onus is on those
            with power to 
            not cause harm and follow an unbiased process for any criminal accusations.
