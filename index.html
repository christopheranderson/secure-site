    <!--

        Merely accessing the source of a webpage 
        is not a crime and we should expect our politicians to
        keep a higher bar before accussing someone, particularly someone in the media who is cooperating with you, just because you're
        embarrassed.

        If you don't know enough to make that distinction, let your more informed deputies
        speak for you.

        An innocent person, trying to help, may be harrassed by random people because of being targetted like this.
        
        Consider your impact before you
        lay charges on someone. The
        onus is on those
        with power to 
        not cause harm and follow an unbiased process for any criminal accusations.
